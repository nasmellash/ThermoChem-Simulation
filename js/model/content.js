    title: "What is Heat (q)?",
    body: `
      Heat (q) is energy transferred due to temperature difference.<br><br>
      Formula:<br>
      q = m · c · ΔT

    title: "What is Specific Heat?",
    body: `
      Specific heat is the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of a
      substance by 1°C.<br><br>
      Water has very high specific heat (4.18), meaning it heats slowly.
